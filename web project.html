<h3>UGA involvement</h3>
<p>
	As a PIH Engage team, our work in Athens would ultimately make PIH's work possible. Of course, fundraising is 
a huge aspect, and Engage teams around the country raised over $400,000 last year. Equally important is the political 
advocacy work that each team strives for. We have our eyes on current bills in Congress that would dramatically 
improve PIH's ability to create real, sustainable systems abroad. It's our goal to reach out to local congressmen 
who can push them forward. PIH Engage is an opportunity for everyday people to make an impact in global health.
In the first semester at UGA, the 2016 Engage team raised almost $9,000 (good for second nationally) in We Will Deliver! 
campaign. These donations went on to fund operations at Pleebo Health Center in Liberia.

	In addition to fundraising efforts and political advocacy, Partners in Health Engage UGA also strives to connect with the Athens area. 
We have worked with Habitat for Humanity and Adopt-a-trail. We work to keep the Trail Creek Greenway clean and safe for everyone to use.
This event is also a great opportunity to get to know team members and have fun doing a good thing.
